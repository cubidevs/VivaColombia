    <string name="history_ibague">This territory was inhabited many years before the discovery by fierce races of Caribbean origin and were called by the Spanish \ "Los pijaos \". On October 14, 1550, the Spanish Captain Andres Lopez de Galarza founded a city with the name of Villa de San Bonifacio de Ibagué, on a plateau surrounded by rivers on the eastern slope of the central mountain range. Ibagué, capital of the department of Tolima, is a land so full of music that its anthem is not a military melody, but a happy song of popular folklore. Not in vain, the city is called the \ 'Musical Capital of Colombia \'. In addition, Ibagué is an important financial and economic hub of Colombia.
